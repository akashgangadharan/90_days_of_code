# 90_days_of_code (Data Structures and Algorithms)
On a journey to underestand Data structures in 90 days. Although not gonna stop after that....

## `Day 1`: Space and Time complexity
Learnt about **`space and time complexity`**. One of the most important part of programming is knowing the complexity of the code you are writing. Helps to understand and evaluate different algorithms in terms of their efficiency.
